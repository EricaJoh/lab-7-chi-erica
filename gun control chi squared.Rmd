Creator (Erica):
getting gc_df data, loading the tidyverse, and getting some summary counts

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter (gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("female", "male")
```
